        "\n",
        "He also touched on the speech spectrum, where he stated that, \"speech is a continuum; a spectrum. There can be acceptable commentary on race and religion. There can be offensive speech. There can be hate speech. Offensive speech can segue into hate speech. And they can overlap.\" He also stated that it was important to have restrictions on offence speech, because of the potential that offensive speech could insidiously seep into the hate speech continuum, and offensive speech could lead to dehumanisation of the target.\n",

        "Mr K. Shanmugam broke down two aspects of offensive speech:\n",

        "1. Speech content (words): derogatory, offensive, and/or insulting to a particular race or religion?\n",
        "2. The likely impact of the speech: the platform of delivery, occasion, reach?"

on fire they think they've found the new messiah and they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong i remember when this whole thing began no talk of god then we called you a man and believe me my admiration for you hasn't died but every word you say today gets twisted 'round some other way and they'll hurt you if they think you've lied nazareth your famous son should have stayed a great unknown like his father carving wood he'd have made good tables chairs and oaken chests would have suited jesus best he'd have caused nobody harm no one alarm listen jesus do you care for your race? don't you see we must keep in our place? we are occupied have you forgotten how put down we are? i am frightened by the crowd for we are getting much too loud and they'll crush us if we go too far if they go too far listen jesus to the warning i give please remember that i want us to live but it's sad to see our chances weakening with every hour all your followers are blind too much heaven on their minds it was beautiful but now it's sour yes it's all gone sour listen jesus to the warning i give please remember that i want us to live c'mon c'mon he won't listen to me  c'mon c'mon he won't

In this project, obtaining the right training set samples and quick retraining was was important, as the style and content of the offensive speech and offensive lyrics coud change rapidly in the wake of a specific terror event, or a specific non-political movement that opposes mainstram racial and religious beliefs, or even a religious movement. Thus, if the iteration of training and retraining is not quick, the model loses its efficiency. Building a **context-aware** model would be challenging."
